          <p>
            GMs create a pool of players they're willing to run for, and offer them campaign settings, game systems, & plot hooks, empowering players to form their own campaigns. Players in that pool then invite each other to campaigns, and each player 'readies up' for times they can play. Once a whole party has "readied up", the session is booked! No more endless scheduling chats, no more wrangling with tools built for corporate meetings. Just more FRIGGIN GAMING
